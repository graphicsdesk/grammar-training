## Setup

1. [Get the most recent version of R](https://cloud.r-project.org/). It is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Download the  version of R compatible with your operating system.

2. Once R is installed, download and install [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/), which is an  “Integrated Development Environment,” or IDE. This means  it is a front-end for R that makes it much easier to work with. R  Studio is also free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux  platforms. 

<!-- GitHub is a web-based service where users can host, hosted on GitHub, rather than R’s central package repository, so  develop, and share code. It uses git, a version control  system that allows projects, or repositories, to  preserve their history and incorporate changes from  contributors in an organized way. -->
