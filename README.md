## Setup

1. [Get the most recent version of R](https://cloud.r-project.org/). It is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Download the  version of R compatible with your operating system.

2. Once R is installed, download and install [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/), which is an "Integrated Development Environment," or IDE. This means  it is a front-end for R that makes it much easier to work with. R  Studio is also free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux  platforms. 

3. Install the tidyverse for R. It is a family of packages that provide useful functionality for graphics, data processing, etc.

To install the tidyverse, make sure you have an internet connection and then launch R Studio. Find the window named "Console" at the bottom left. In the console, you can type commands after the ">" prompt and R will then execute your command. Type the following line of code at the R's command prompt in Console and hit return.

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

<!-- GitHub is a web-based service where users can host, hosted on GitHub, rather than Râ€™s central package repository, so  develop, and share code. It uses git, a version control  system that allows projects, or repositories, to  preserve their history and incorporate changes from  contributors in an organized way. -->
